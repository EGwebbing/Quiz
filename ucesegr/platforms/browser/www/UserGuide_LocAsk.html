<h2><span lang=EN-GB>How to install the app</h2> <!-- Installation process that should be followed by the user -->
<p>LocAsk is still nor present on Google Play Store, therefore, it has to be downloaded and installed manually. In order to do so, the user must allow the 
installation from <i>unknown sources</i> on his device. In most Android phones, this option is found in the <i>security</i> section within the settings.</p>
<p>The installation process needs to be initialized from the following link: 
<a href="https://build.phonegap.com/apps/3148274/share">https://build.phonegap.com/apps/3148274/share</a>.</p>
<p><span >Once here there are two ways to download the app:</p>
<p><b>1-</b> Scan the QR code provided and follow the manufacturer instructions to complete the installation process;</p>
<p><b>2-</b> Download the .apk file on the PC and move it to a phone directory that can be accessed from the phone</p>


<h2>How the app works</h2> <!-- Explanation about how the app works by showing the main parts that compose the interface -->
<p>LocAsk uses the built-in hardware capability of mobile devices to track the position of the user. Depending on user position and his proximity 
to one or more points of interest, several actions and pop alerts can be displayed. 
The app is composed of two main parts: 
the main body and the left-side menu</p>

<h3>- The main body</h3>
<p>The main body contains the tools that enable the user to load the questions and answer the quiz. This part consists of:</p>
<p><b>The map</b>: here the user can see his current position and the location of the points of interest (each point is linked to a question) 
<p><b>The question</b>: this section contains the question and the related answers that appear when the user is near enough to a point of
interest.</p>
<p><b>The submit button</b>: verifies the user input answer to communicate whether or not it is correct and uploads the result on the database.</p>

<h3>- The left-side menu</h3>
<p>This menu can be opened by tapping on the three parallel lines icon in the top-left corner of the interface. Here the user has four options:</p>
<p><b>Load points of interest</b>: the button loads the points of interest which are the key core of the quiz. </p>
<p><b>Enable location tracking</b>: once clicked, the option activates the continous tracking and searchs for nearby points of interest. If the user is close 
enough to one of them, a pop-up window will appear alerting that there is a question to be answered below. Otherwise, if the user is too far from a point of interest
 another pop-up window will notify him that he is too far and that there are no points nearby.</p>
<p><b>Refresh questions</b>: enables the user to re-load all questions allowing him to re-attempt the quiz to try find the correct answer.</p>
<p><b>Clear View</b>: this option removes any data showed on the map. The user should only use this option if they want to start over the quiz and 
load points of interest again.</p>
